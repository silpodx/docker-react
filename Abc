[+] as explained in the lecture notes, Dockerfile.dev was adjusted from its 
    std form because of some permission issues with linux... in order to make
    real-time adj to code and see it on the web-page without rebuilding.

    Copied initial/std form of it here to: _std_Dockerfile.dev
    [hope it doesn't mess up things...]

    Dockerfile does not need that and is std.
