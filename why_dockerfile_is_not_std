There is an issue with permissions in regards to Linux hosts (which includes Windows WSL2) and volumes. It can be solved by doing the following:


    FROM node:alpine

    USER node

    RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app
    WORKDIR /home/node/app

    COPY --chown=node:node ./package.json ./
    RUN npm install
    COPY --chown=node:node ./ ./

    CMD ["npm", "start"]


Remember to update the working directory paths in your docker run command to /home/node/app instead of just /app

eg:

docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v /home/node/app/node_modules -v ~/my-project-directory:/home/node/app IMAGE_ID


When we refactor to use Docker Compose, remember to update the working directory paths in your compose file:

volumes:

        volumes:
          - /home/node/app/node_modules
          - .:/home/node/app

Explanation of changes:

We are specifying that the USER which will execute RUN, CMD, or ENTRYPOINT instructions will be the node user, as opposed to root (default).

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user

We are then creating a directory of /home/node/app prior to the WORKDIR instruction. This will prevent a permissions issue since WORKDIR by default will create a directory if it does not exist and set ownership to root.

The inline chown commands will set ownership of the files you are copying from your local environment to the node user in the container.

The end result will be that all files and directories in the project will no longer be owned by root and will instead be owned by the node user.


The code above was taken from this thread:

Also, you can read up on the chown flag for the COPY instruction here:
